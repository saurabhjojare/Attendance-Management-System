### Employee Salary Management

The Salary Management System deals with the financial aspects of employees' salaries, allowances, deductions, gross pay, net pay, etc., and generation of pay-slips for a specific period. The outstanding benefit of the Salary Management System is its easy implementation. The Employee Salary Management system helps you easily manage monthly salary and define slabs for CTC.
